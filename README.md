# Arduino-ESP32

This repository will give you an insight on how to code for an I2c based communication protocol using the WIRE library from the bq34z100 integrated circuit to the Arduino/ESP32 , giving us the battery parameters.

The main objective is to show how Data is uploaded to the various cloud services such as ThingSpeak and 
AWS using ESP32 with the Arduino IDE.

There is also code added, on using in the real time clock , bluetooth and SD card modules.
